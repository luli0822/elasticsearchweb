Welcome to Elasticsearch Sample Web
-------------------------------
This repo is a simple web application that processes CRUD operations towards to an Elasticsearch server where you can set it via YAML file.

Before launching the application, please start your local or remote Elasticsearch server and it's good to run the Kibana if you have installed it as well.

To run the application, there're a couple of ways, use the following commands in your terminal after going under the folder "/elasticsearchweb",

Option 1. mvn spring-boot:run (you need to install maven tool on your machine)

Option 2. java -jar target/sampleelasticsearch-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar (you need to install java)


To to the integration testing for the application, use the following command in your terminal after going under the folder "/elasticsearchweb":
$ mvn test

Future TODOs
1. Replace Vaadin UI with Angular or React framework as these frontend frameworks are more scalable and decoupled way that integrates with Restful services, especially thinking of microservice architecture.

2. Provide a way to update yaml file via input params for configuring remote Elasticsearch server and host when launching the application.
